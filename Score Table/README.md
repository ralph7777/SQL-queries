# Student Score Table

This program is to report student scores according to information in certain tables, using script in PL/SQL.


There are two established tables:

1. The table STUDENT has attributes ID, Name, Midterm, Final, and Homework;

2. The table WEIGHTS has attributes MidPct, FinPct, and HWPct;


The script file containing an anonymous PL/SQL block does the following:  

First, report the three weights found in the WEIGHTS table.

Next, output the ID and name of each student in the STUDENT table and their overall score.

Also convert each studentâ€™s overall score to a letter grade (90-100=A, 80-89.99=B, 65-79.99=C, 0-64.99=F).
